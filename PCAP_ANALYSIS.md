PCAP Support Implementation Analysis for LogSnoop
=================================================

## Difficulty Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ MODERATE-CHALLENGING (4/5 stars)

### Implementation Complexity:
- Time Estimate: 4-6 hours for full implementation
- Lines of Code: ~500-800 lines (plugin + tests)
- Dependencies: 1-2 new Python packages (scapy or pyshark)
- Integration: Fits perfectly into existing plugin architecture

### Technical Requirements:

1. **PCAP Parsing Library Options:**

   Option A: Scapy (Recommended)
   ✅ Pure Python, fast, lightweight
   ✅ Excellent packet parsing
   ✅ Built-in protocol support
   ✅ Easy to install: pip install scapy
   ❌ May need WinPcap on Windows

   Option B: PyShark
   ✅ Wireshark-based parsing
   ✅ Very comprehensive protocol support
   ❌ Requires tshark/Wireshark installed
   ❌ Heavier dependency

   **Recommendation: Scapy for better compatibility**

2. **Data Structure Design:**

   Extract these fields from packets:
   - timestamp (when packet was captured)
   - source_ip, destination_ip (for table view compatibility)
   - source_port, destination_port
   - protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
   - packet_size, payload_size
   - tcp_flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)
   - http_method, http_url (if HTTP traffic)
   - dns_query (if DNS traffic)
   - event_type (connection, request, response, etc.)
   - status (for HTTP status codes)

3. **Query Types to Implement:**

   Network Analysis:
   - top_talkers: Most active IP addresses
   - protocol_breakdown: Traffic by protocol
   - bandwidth_usage: Data transfer analysis
   - connection_analysis: TCP connection patterns
   - port_scan_detection: Identify scanning activity

   Application Layer:
   - http_requests: Web traffic analysis
   - dns_queries: DNS lookup patterns
   - top_domains: Most accessed domains
   - user_agents: Browser/client analysis
   - response_codes: HTTP status analysis

   Security Focused:
   - suspicious_ports: Non-standard port usage
   - failed_connections: Connection failures
   - data_exfiltration: Large outbound transfers
   - geo_analysis: Traffic by country (with GeoIP)

### Implementation Plan:

Step 1: Create pcap_network.py plugin
Step 2: Implement packet parsing with Scapy
Step 3: Add 15-20 network analysis queries
Step 4: Test with sample PCAP files
Step 5: Update documentation and requirements

### Benefits for LogSnoop:

Network Forensics:
✅ Analyze captured network traffic
✅ Identify suspicious connections
✅ Track data exfiltration
✅ Monitor application usage

Security Analysis:
✅ Port scan detection
✅ Protocol anomaly detection
✅ Bandwidth monitoring
✅ Connection pattern analysis

Integration:
✅ Works with existing table view
✅ Uses same database structure
✅ Compatible with interactive mode
✅ Tab completion for .pcap files

### Sample Usage:

```bash
# Parse network capture
logsnoop parse capture.pcap pcap_network

# Analyze top talkers
logsnoop query pcap_network top_talkers

# Check for port scans
logsnoop query pcap_network port_scan_detection

# HTTP traffic analysis
logsnoop query pcap_network http_requests

# Interactive mode
logsnoop interactive
> 1. Parse new file
> Select pcap_network plugin
> Browse to .pcap file with TAB completion
```

### Challenges & Solutions:

Challenge 1: Large PCAP files
Solution: Stream processing, configurable limits

Challenge 2: Complex protocols
Solution: Start with basic protocols, expand gradually

Challenge 3: Performance
Solution: Efficient packet filtering, batch processing

Challenge 4: Memory usage
Solution: Process packets in chunks, don't load all at once

### Perfect for Kali Linux:

- Wireshark integration (tcpdump, tshark)
- Network penetration testing analysis
- Incident response and forensics
- Traffic monitoring and analysis
- Protocol reverse engineering

Would integrate seamlessly with existing LogSnoop workflow!
