### 4. Command Analysis (`telnet_commands`)
**Purpose**: Extraction and categorization of executed commands
**Capabilities**:
- Command extraction from traffic
- Command categorization (directory, file operations, privileges, etc.)
- Frequency analysis
- Security risk assessment
- Suspicious command detection

**Command Categories**:
- Directory operations (`ls`, `dir`, `pwd`)
- File viewing (`cat`, `type`, `more`)
- File manipulation (`rm`, `cp`, `mv`)
- Privilege escalation (`su`, `sudo`, `chmod`)
- Downloads (`wget`, `curl`)
- Session management (`logout`, `exit`)

### 5. Traffic Pattern Analysis (`telnet_traffic`)
**Purpose**: Communication flow and timing analysis
**Capabilities**:
- Packet direction analysis (client→server vs server→client)
- Packet size statistics
- Communication timing
- Data flow rates
- Connection pattern analysis

**Metrics Provided**:
- Total packets and directional breakdown
- Average/min/max packet sizes
- Session duration and packet rates
- Timeline analysis

### 6. Security Assessment (`telnet_security`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security risk evaluation
**Capabilities**:
- Security score calculation (0-100)
- Risk level assessment (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Vulnerability identification
- Threat analysis
- Actionable recommendations

**Security Findings**:
- Protocol encryption status
- Credential exposure detection
- Suspicious command identification
- Brute force attempt analysis
- Network security recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Plugin**: PCAP Network Plugin (`pcap_network`)
- **Dependencies**: Scapy for packet parsing
- **Storage**: SQLite database with forensic integrity
- **Analysis Engine**: Regex pattern matching and heuristic analysis

### Query Methods
```python
# Six new analysis methods added:
_query_telnet_analysis()        # Overview statistics
_query_telnet_sessions()        # Session reconstruction  
_query_telnet_authentication()  # Auth event analysis
_query_telnet_commands()        # Command extraction
_query_telnet_traffic()         # Traffic patterns
_query_telnet_security()        # Security assessment
```

### Security Features
- **Password Redaction**: Passwords are automatically redacted in logs
- **Credential Warnings**: Clear warnings about plaintext credential exposure
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated security scoring and risk classification
- **Forensic Integrity**: All data preserved for investigation

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Parse Telnet PCAP file
python cli.py parse telnet_capture.pcap pcap_network

# Run specific analyses
python cli.py query pcap_network telnet_analysis --file-id 1
python cli.py query pcap_network telnet_authentication --file-id 1
python cli.py query pcap_network telnet_security --file-id 1
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from logsnoop.core import LogParser

parser = LogParser()
result = parser.parse_log_file("telnet.pcap", "pcap_network")
file_id = result['file_id']

# Security assessment
security = parser.query_logs("pcap_network", "telnet_security", file_id=file_id)
print(f"Risk Level: {security['risk_level']}")
print(f"Security Score: {security['security_score']}/100")
```

## Forensic Value

### Investigation Capabilities
1. **Credential Recovery**: Extract usernames and detect password attempts
2. **Command Reconstruction**: See exactly what commands were executed
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Understand sequence of events
4. **Security Assessment**: Identify vulnerabilities and risks
5. **Evidence Preservation**: Maintain forensic integrity of captured data

### Network Security Applications
- **Incident Response**: Analyze compromised Telnet sessions
- **Compliance Auditing**: Identify insecure protocol usage
- **Threat Hunting**: Detect malicious Telnet activity
- **Security Training**: Demonstrate Telnet vulnerabilities
- **Policy Enforcement**: Monitor for unauthorized Telnet usage

## Test Results

### Sample Analysis (Telnet.pcap)
- **File**: 113 packets, 7.8KB total
- **Session**: 192.168.1.140:56760 ↔ 192.168.1.194:23
- **Duration**: 14.26 seconds
- **Authentication**: 1 successful login (username: "test")
- **Security Score**: 60/100 (CRITICAL risk)
- **Commands**: Session analysis shows login sequence and system information

### Key Findings
- Successfully detected authentication flow
- Captured username in plaintext
- Identified password transmission (redacted for security)
- Generated security warnings about protocol vulnerabilities
- Provided actionable remediation recommendations

## Security Recommendations

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Unencrypted Protocol**: All data transmitted in plaintext
2. **Credential Exposure**: Usernames and passwords visible to network sniffers
3. **Command Visibility**: All commands and responses can be intercepted
4. **No Integrity Protection**: Traffic can be modified in transit

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Replace with SSH**: Immediately migrate to SSH for all remote access
2. **Change Passwords**: Update any credentials transmitted via Telnet
3. **Network Monitoring**: Implement detection for Telnet usage
4. **Security Policies**: Establish secure remote access procedures
5. **Network Segmentation**: Restrict Telnet access where still required
